Implement async and await instead of fetch() and .then.  It makes the code shorter and readable.
<br>
Use Live Server to inspect the result while testing.  Without it, it cannot fetch the data as CORS issue by trying to get data from client side.

Note
<br>
Number in CSV file is String so we need to convert the number into Number by using parseInt or parseFloat.

Tip
